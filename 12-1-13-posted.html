	<p class="blurb"><b>Instructions</b>
		<br><br>In this HIT you will help us improve a system which generates descriptions for pictures. You'll see <span class="numquestions">{{}}</span> questions, each consisting of a picture and a sentence. Your job is to help us determine how good the sentence is as a description of the picture.</p>

		<p class="blurb">For example, you might see a picture like this:</p>
		<br>
		<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:380px; height:350px;" src="example.png"></img>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="blurb">The description you read might be, for example, "All of the red dots are on the right side", or "There are five red dots".</p>
		<br>
		<p class="blurb">You should indicate the quality of the description using the slider, which represents a continuous measure of the quality of a description. To help you choose a value, for different locations of the slider you will also see a number between 0 ("<span class="mintxt">{{}}</span>") and 100 ("<span class="maxtxt">{{}}</span>"). The slider will start on a different, randomly chosen number each time.</p>

<div class="questions">

	<div id="sliderexamplediv">
  	
<table style="margin:auto;">
<tr>
  	<td class="mintxt" style="padding-right:5px; width:30px; text-align:center;">{{}}
  	</td>	
  	<td>
		<div id="track0" style="margin:auto; width:300px; background-color:#ccc; height:10px;">
			<div id="handle0" style="width:10px; height:15px; background-color:#f00; cursor:move;"></div>
		</div> 
	</td>
	<td class="maxtxt" style="padding-left:5px; width:30px; text-align:center;">{{}}
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p id="debug0">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>

		<p class="blurb">
		Sometimes a description will be clearly appropriate or inappropriate, but sometimes it will not. For example, "All of the red dots are on the right side of the picture" is not a great description of this picture, but you might feel that "There are five red dots" is OK (but not great). If so, the latter deserves a middling value.</p>

		<p class='blurb'>All such responses are useful information for us. When you feel that a description is clearly appropriate or inappropriate, choose an extreme value. If you feel that a description is somewhat, but not fully, appropriate, indicate your intuition by selecting an intermediate value.
